## About Me  

I‚Äôm an **AI/ML Engineer and Space Systems Guy** based in Berlin, Germany.  
My journey began with **Aerospace Engineering in India**, evolved through **space research in Europe & the US**, and culminated in an **MSc in Space Engineering at TU Berlin**.  

- 5+ years building **AI/ML pipelines, satellite databases, and scalable cloud-native apps**  
- 20+ **publications in space systems & AI** (IAC, EGU, etc.)  
- Hands-on with **Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR)**, EO data, orbital mechanics, and geodesy  
- Passionate about **AI for Space Sustainability** and **Earth system intelligence**  

I thrive on projects that **bridge research and real-world impact**, whether it‚Äôs **space debris mitigation**, **AI for climate risk forecasting**, or **cognitive chatbots with memory**.
